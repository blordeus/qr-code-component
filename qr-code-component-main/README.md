## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS
* CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to better implement CSS Flexbox into my projects. This helped organize the parent and child elements.

``` css
.qrsection {
    background-color: white;
    display: flex;
    padding: 4% 2%;
    flex-direction: column;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    border-radius: 10px;
    margin: auto;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue developing my JavaScript skills and frameworks such as React and Vue. I also want to refine my HTML and CSS skills so I can continue to grow as a front-end developer.

### Useful resources

* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) \- This website helped me better understand how CSS flexbox works and provided examples on how to use it in certain situations\.
